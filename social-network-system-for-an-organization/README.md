Working – The system would allow an employee to log into the application and see all the employees list. Employees can chat with each other if they are friends.
Problem statement – To make someone your friend, you need to have at least one mutual friend. So, a user should be shown the list of minimum employees he/she would have to be friends with to finally make someone his/her friend.
